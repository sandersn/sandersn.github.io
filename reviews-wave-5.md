# Reviews Wave 5

Summary of which games I played. Recommendations.

## Gears of War 3
Gears 3 is definitely more Gears of War. Well-crafted, slight improvement over the previous two, cleverer than it seems, and a little too consistently loud for my taste.
## Control
Control is a fun, polished narrative with decent moment-to-moment gameplay. I liked it a lot, although the weird part is: even though the modern collectible/levelling/rando-quests feel tacked on, I liked them. Even the Metroidvania-style world feels tacked on! Sam Lake's over-the-top, creepy-adjacent writing elevates what would otherwise be the perfect average of modern games.
## Metro 2033
Metro 2033 is a weird kind of Eurojanky: it feels like a small team imitating what they love on a shoestring--here, Call of Duty or Half-Life. But the scope is tight and the polish is high. Then again, almost every level has a broken trigger, a too-fast tutorial, or unsignposted jump. Overall, I was impressed, but frustrated a lot of the time. So, yeah, Eurojank.
## STALKER: Call of Pripyat
STALKER is classic Eurojank open-world RPG that wants to be Fallout and Witcher at the same time. Anecdote: Some stalkers asked for help to fight some bandits at midnight. I went early, where the bandits asked me to double-cross the stalkers. Come midnight, I couldn't see in the pitch black, so I stumbled around until a bandit found me and thanked me for helping them win. Back at the stalker hideout next morning, I was still just as welcome there.
## The Looker
If you were curious about the Witness but didn't want to spend the time or money, the Looker is a free, short parody that will give you the flavour of it. Some of the twists are on the same level as the Witness, although there are unpolished edges in places.
## Assassin's Creed Syndicate
Syndicate reminds me that atmosphere is the main reason I play Assassin's Creed. It's technically similar to Unity, but Victorian London just isn't as interesting. Doesn't help that the characters take the world even less seriously. Syndicate does have the best stealth in the series! But still matched with boring level design.
## Final Fantasy 14
I really *really* want to like FF14, but the game hurries you through the free part so fast now. I'm here for the atmosphere, not the plot! The rush kills the atmosphere. I don't have time to poke around, fight 7 moose mice or whatever.
## Outward
On my second attempt at Outward, I tried grinding and mastering the mechanics instead of exploring areas I wasn't ready for. Uh, and it didn't work. I still hit a difficulty wall a couple of hours in, and entered a downward spiral. There must be some way to prosper in this game, but I can't find it.
## Far Cry 5
Far Cry 5 starts off fine--the starter island is like earlier Far Crys. But the game proper makes many small changes to the formula; the result is noisy and hyperactive. Also, like must Ubisoft games, the only way to stand the game is to not let a single word out of a cutscene before skipping it.
## Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy
I did not Get Over It this time, but I got far enough to pretend I could with enough hard work. At least, I consistently got past The Devil's Chimney. (I can't remember if that's the official name or the one my kid made up.)
## Brume
Very spare and short. Clearly inspired by Dark Souls and Ico, which is good, but the bad part is that "Dark Souls+Ico" tells you 90% of what you need to know.
## Rain World
Wow. It is so atmospheric and fun to look at. And stressful! Very, very stressful not knowing where to hide for the night, where to find food, what will jump out at me, or whether a path will loop right back into a lion's den. I didn't make it very far.
## Spirit Hunters: Infinite Horde
I heard about Spirit Hunters from John Walker on buriedtreasure.org. It's exactly Vampire Survivor, but with a more complex outer loop and less complex inner loop. It shows that the Vampire Survivor formula isn't a fluke, but it's also not a significant advancement.
