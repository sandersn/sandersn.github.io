# Reviews Wave 8
## Might and Magic 7
Might and Magic 7 has the right balance of directed RPG with Ubisoft-style popcorn-addictive open worlds. New World Computing really excelled at the latter. 

Might and Magic 7 is smaller and its world is more detailed. Dungeons are still just as interesting, but now they're part of the main quest more often than not.

Also they added a tutorial island. Cliched now, but..probably cliched then too? And the best card mini-game I've played. Exactly the same popcorn-addictive flavour in a card game.

## Anachronox
Anachronox, remember, is the *not-Deus Ex* game by Ion Storm. The graphics look pretty similar, but it's a JRPG with a Han Solo vibe. Unique for the time &mdash; made in the USA &mdash; and also now &mdash; comedic JRPG. Ultimately, JRPGs have to be amazing for me to stick with them, and Anachronox wasn't that special. The pacing bogs down into a linear series of adventure-game-lite quests that seem to be mostly inspired by puns.

Shout out to the early level design which felt like a cross between Hong Kong in Deus Ex and Midgard in Final Fantasy, but more confusing. It's wasn't *good* but it sure was *distinctive*.

## Mount and Blade
This is a cool simulation-focussed Eurojank thing, but I didn't quite get into it. I did play enough to start growing my warband and get in a few battles.

The various parts are individually hard to approach.

## Planescape: Torment
I played the first 2/3 of this game 10 years ago. Now: it's OK. I can see how it's meaningful for somebody who is younger and has the ability to last through the D&D gameplay. 

## Death Stranding
Death Stranding is Hideo Kojima's hiking game about his vacation to Greenland, and his thoughts on the fracturing of the United States. It's not obvious, but it's a continuation on his efforts/style/attempts in Metal Gear. And it's an improvement nearly everywhere except for the integration between story and mechanics. In particular, I feel like Kojima finally made a successful anti-war game, even though it's nestled inside a weird walking simulator. All those hilarious bosses from previous games? They're now friends you meet along the way. Or at least characters.

It's also successfully surreal.

Oh, well, the sneaking is more stressful than Metal Gear because the enemies are either invisible or can't be attacked without risking an antimatter explosion.

Hilarious weird. I loved the characters and story because of their incomprehensibility.

The basic gameplay is exactly what I want from a game every great once in a while. But the sneaking is more stressful than Metal Gear and not as fun.
## Max Payne 3
Max Payne 3 is actually a decent game, and mechanically similar to the first two. It's just not written by Sam Lake. There's little of the purple prose of Max Payne and the (slightly) subtler strangeness of Max Payne 2. It's very much a Rock Star game, with piquant observations of life that might reasonably rattle around in the head of hired killer.

## Deadly Premonition
Deadly Premonition is a cult game for a reason. It's a barely-working wannabe mix of Grand Theft Auto, Resident Evil and Twin Peaks. With influences from Majora's Mask and Metal Gear. When it's working it's fascinating. When it's not (which is most of the time), it's hilarious. Unfortunately my save refused to load after Chapter 6, but at least I got to experience the open world and some of its activities.

## Budget Cuts
Budget Cuts seems like a good idea: a stealth game in VR. I really didn't like it, though. I'm not sure why, unfortunately. One possibility: the last quarter isn't well polished, with insta-fail sections that are either obtuse or obvious-but-hard. Mistakes are magnified in VR. Another possibility is that teleport movement doesn't scale to a longer game. Or any game, really. Under pressure, it's too hard to aim well and correct mistakes. Actually, I think teleport is not a good solution for virtual movement--it's an accessibility option for people who can't use smooth motion.

The overall effect feels extremely like Ultima Underworld's mouse-driven interface, which was simple but similarly fiddly. (It's not just true 3D either--Ultima 7, Might and Magic 4/5 and King's Quest 6 all have clunky mouse-only interfaces.)

## Cycle: Frontier
Cycle: Frontier is an extraction shooter that focusses on PvE. In theory that sounds like it could be fun. But the reality was that the PvE part was badly explained and rather boring. I played right before the game shut down, so it's not a surprise that the PvP part was -- dead. I saw a couple other people, who seemed almost as disoriented as I was.

So I need to refine my search for a casual extraction shooter. If Fortnite had an extraction shooter mode, its large, inexperienced player population would make that fun for me. Actually, Fortnite has player-made modes now, so this surely exists. I don't know, I gave up on the search for now.

## Rogue Legacy
I've never finished Rogue Legacy&mdash;it's a rogue-like platformer after all&mdash;but I play it every few years. It's still fun, still has that rogue-like good-build randomness and rogue-like rapid difficulty scaling. The platforming feels just a tiny bit zoomed-in, and the edge-off-screen markers are a patch, not a real fix.

It's a rogue-like, is what I'm saying.

## Curse of the Crescent Isle
Curse of the Crescent Isle is a Wonder Boy clone (Monster World IV specifically). It's not very polished but it's the work of basically one person. I quit at a boss where I had to do a specific thing several times in a row, but that thing failed sometimes outside my control.

## Gunmetal Arcadia Zero
Gunmetal Arcadia Zero is a lot like Castlevania 2, but more emphasis on action.
