I had a little time while camping and wanted to practise drawing from life, not from a picture. And I wanted to focus on a single object while still making a decent background. The simple shape of the bottle worked well, but I was no good at choosing colours--and I didn't use enough layers to easily change the choice afterward.

I thought it would be funny to use an AI-generated picture of models as a reference to practise drawing faces. Joke's on me: I think the faces are OK, but the rest of the picture had weird quirks that are probably the AI messing up.
