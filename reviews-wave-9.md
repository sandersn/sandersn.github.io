# Reviews Wave 9
## Half-Life 2 VR
Half-Life 2 is amazing in VR. I mean, it's amazing outside as well, but VR puts you inside the game.

High-resolution VR does make the assets look the slightest bit aged, though. It's the first time I've thought that about Half-Life 2.

## Might and Magic 8
Might and Magic 8 is a tweak of the formula that Might and Magic 7 got right. It's interesting but none of the changes really improve things.

And: it's smaller still. 7 felt exactly the right size for a directed RPG. 8 feels a little claustrophobic in parts.
Unfortunately it also has parts that are just padded with enemies. Smaller yet padded. It's not a good combination.

Might and Magic 6/7/8 were right in the middle of skueuomorphic user interfaces, yet all 3 have different takes on it. 6 looks like a picture of some cool things, 8 looks like a drawing of some cool things, and 7 is somewhere in the middle. None of the UIs are as readable the one from 4 and 5.

## Risen

Risen is interesting because it asks the question, "what if we made the back-and-forth talking kind of quest *really hard*, and the main part of the game?" (in the first third at least). Turns out it's super interesting!

The combat is extremely bad -- doesn't feel significantly changed from Gothic 1. Well, the conversation isn't much changed either, honestly.

Disclaimer: Eurojank, so it comes with *significant* amounts of sexism (and blind-spot racism -- the whole game is whites-only as far as I recall).

## Two Worlds II

Ha ha, were we talking about mention sexist, racist Eurojank? Let me introduce Two Worlds II. Oddly compelling despite incredible jank, questionable designs. The level design is just weird throughout, but especially in the design of the zones. The first one is an open savannah, extremely generic North African. The second is mostly a city plus a giant gloomy labyrinth, extremely generic East Asian. The third is a tiny haunted swamp, generic Central European.

On the surface, Two Worlds seemed like an Oblivion rip-off. Two Worlds II seemed like a Witcher 2 rip-off on the surface. A little deeper, Two Worlds had some interesting ideas and pretty addictive systems. Two Worlds II has an overloaded life-raft of video game systems packed in there, some sinking below the surface. None are well explained, some seem unusable, but they're bursting with enthusiasm.

The combat difficulty curve is weird, but justifiable for an RPG.

## Fallout 3/New Vegas

I remember liking Fallout 3 in wandering sort of way, in which I found new weird things scattered around. I also remember the difficulty of the subway tunnels being well-considered, with the treat of exploring above-ground DC as a prize. But the rest faded into a much of "pretty good game". Fallout New Vegas, on the other hand, a little too hard at the beginning and didn't have as many odd little spots to poke at. Everything was part of one story or another. I appreciated it as a game but didn't like it as much as Fallout 3.

On replay, though. Well. Fallout 3 is clunky and repititive enough to feel like it's wasting your time. Fallout New Vegas makes you look forward to the big things that you know are coming. The more businesslike, goal-focussed way I go at replays really makes New Vegas shine.

## Xanadu Next
Hey it's Japanese Diablo! Built on the Ys engine.

## Amnesia: The Dark Descent
Well, it sure is a horror game. I know this is one of the classics but I'm just not a horror maven. It felt like A Horror Game and that's all I got.

Not quite all: I really liked the physicality of control, where you could drag windows and levers up and down with a click-and-hold. Sort of point and clicky, but way better to control than, say, System Shock or Ultima Underworld. (Also less interactive overall, so)

## Republique
So much budget on kinda blah gameplay. But they were chasing two gold rushes in a row.

I played the VR version, and I admit, the structure fits will with early VR games. Point-to-point camera movement and the frequent cutscenes feel like a stage play with you on the front row. It's just not that fun or easy to control to point-n-click sneak a character around.

## SUPERHOT VR
This sure is an amazing 75-second loop. It's good enough that the first time through I wanted to see it all. This time I had fun for 75 seconds.

## Streets of Rogue
I got to the last level this time!

I know this claims to be an "immersive sim lite", but that's only because "immersive sim" and 2000s-era "sandbox games" are sibling genres -- it's more of the latter. Combining that with rogue-like is excellent, though, because it frees *my* mind enough to actually enjoy messing around with the simulation, something I don't like doing in those old sandbox games with a story and a defined character.

## Inmost
Hey, yeah, it's a cinematic platformer in the vein of Limbo or Oddworld. The puzzles and control were snappy enough to make up for the "die here, now guess what the designer was thinking here to pass" approach.

## Lucifer Among Us
It was a nice story, if a little predictable. Solving the mystery was, honestly, more sensible than Phoenix Wright, but not nearly as much faced, with an unsmiling presentation fore and aft.

## Xenoblade Chronicles X

Really good, interesting open world traversal with MMO toolset. The secret is: so much verticality that you can't get everywhere till you get better tools. But you can get *some* interesting places if you work hard early.
## Go Home Dinosaurs
Pretty standard and boring tower defence.
