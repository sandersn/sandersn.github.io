# Bigscreen Beyond Review

## First Impressions

My previous headsets were the Vive and the HP Reverb G2.

The lens and focus are quite good in the sweet spot, decent just outside it, but the sweet spot is extremely small. 
Edge-to-edge clarity seems worse than both my previous headsets&mdash;but mostly I've been playing 2D games, where I'm more used to eye movement for checking edges and less used to head movement.
From a short bit of SUPERHOT VR and COMPOUND (those are the real ways to spell them, look it up), the field of view seems slightly worse than the Vive and Reverb as well.
All in all, I think I got the right IPD, or very close, but the gasket could maybe be thinner.
Looking at it, though, the thinnest point is around 1 cm, so I don't know if that's reasonable.

Notably, I got two IPD measurements, one some years ago at 56.5mm (a machine) and one this year at 58mm (my trusted human optometrist), so I got a 57mm headset.
A 56mm might be better but I doubt it.

Resolution, colour and brightness: the resolution is noticeably better than the already-good Reverb G2. The Reverb felt like VR had reached the equivalent of 1080p or maybe 1440p 2D displays--this feels like something more. Probably 4K, but my eyes are old enough that it just looks very smooth and sharp. The Beyond defaults to 75hz full resolution and I think that's the right idea -- at least until I try a very active game.
The brightness is fine at 100%, although I could notice that my not-very-bright TV was visibly brighter when I took off the headset.

I hardly ever play games for more than an hour, so I probably won't comment on long-term comfort.
Putting on the Beyond feels like swim goggles where the Reverb felt like a ridiculous hat and the Vive felt like a hat-mask-vice.
Once on, I appreciate the smaller footprint on my face, and lighter weight. The cord is so stiff that it drags the headset down unless you brace it in the clip on the back.
After an hour of playing, it still felt quite comfortable. However, my face sweat underneath the gasket, and it left me with two wicked marks, darker than I've gotten from my other two headsets.
This despite it being more comfortable than those two: I think it's because there's less pressure overall, it's just concentrated in two small spots.

The soft strap is comfortable enough but doesn't stay in place very well.
Combined with the tiny sweet spot and tiny size of the headset, it turns out my normal headphones are basically unworkable.
I ordered some bluetooth earbuds and in the meantime I'm using the cheapo speakers on my TV.
But I'm going to order the audio strap if/when it's available, because I like the Reverb's Index-inspired strap so much.

Software: It is good to be back on SteamVR-only. The only complaint I have is that SteamVR now uses the Steam Deck interface but doesn't support controller nagivation.

I'm going to try replacing my old-ish 1080p/60hz TV with the Beyond for a little while to see how it goes.
