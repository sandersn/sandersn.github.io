# Bigscreen Beyond Review

## Background

My previous headsets were the Vive and the HP Reverb G2.
I had used the Beyond for about a week in total when I first wrote this.
Now I've had the Bigscreen Beyond for about 9 months and I bought the audio head strap a couple of months ago.

I usually play slow, single-player games in VR, for example, Subnautica and Skyrim.
Half-Life 2 is probably the most active one I've played.

## Clarity

The resolution is noticeably better than the already-good Reverb G2. 
The Reverb felt like VR had reached the equivalent of 1080p or maybe 1440p 2D displays--this feels like something more. 
Probably 4K, but my eyes are old enough that it just looks very smooth and sharp.
Notably, text and 2D UI is looks really good, which was definitely not the case with the Vive and was just "good" with the G2.

The focus is quite clear in the sweet spot, solid just outside it, but the sweet spot is extremely small.
That's because, unlike my other two headsets, there's a linear falloff of clarity, instead of a "good region" and "fuzzy region".
The lenses are tiny and called "pancake lenses", so that's probably why.

Combined, that means the precise centre looks *amazing* and the bit around it is very good.
But, even though the field of view is technically about the same as the G2 and the Vive, focussing on things means turning your head.
If I were an owl this would be the perfect headset (for peripheral vision, the fuzziness is fine, of course.)

Another trick this headset uses to improve field of view is to cant the screens outward a bit.
However, this makes vergence on near things harder&mdash;I notice it about less than 30 cm or so, such as when subtitles are mistakenly set too close to the camera. 
I like this tradeoff because you don't commonly focus on things less than 30 cm away in VR (and, again, I'm old, so my eyes also have to work extra hard to *focus* on close things as well).


Because the sweet spot is so small, getting the right IPD is important.
Fortunately, this is based on your face scan. 
For example, I got two optometrist IPD measurements, one some years ago at 56.5mm (a machine) and one this year at 58mm (a trusted human optometrist), so I got a 57mm headset, based on advice from Bigscreen.
Although the default strap is more comfortable (see below), the tighter fit of the audio headstrap improves the sweet spot a bit.
It also improves glare a lot: another drawback of the lenses is that light-on-dark produces smeary glare around the edges. 
It's much softer than the similar glare of the Vive's fresnel lenses, but also bigger.
In practise, it's not bad, for a couple of reasons.

1. Most games don't have strong, important light-dark edges.
2. In action, you're not paying attention to the edges of your vision.
3. The edges of your vision are fuzzy to boot!

However, using the Bigscreen for work might be annoying, especially if you're tied to dark mode.


All in all, I think I got the right IPD, or very close, but the gasket could maybe be thinner.
My eyelashes are definitely not touching the lenses and seem slightly further than either of my previous headsets (although I swapped the Vive gasket out for a thinner one).
Looking at it, though, the thinnest point is around 1 cm, so maybe there's not much room to go thinner.

TODO: Mention glare, perhaps around the IPD section.

The Beyond defaults to 75hz full resolution and I think that's the right idea -- at least until I try a very active game (I've played Superhot, Compound, Republique, Half-Life 2, Half-Life Alyx, none of which are very fast-moving.)
TODO: Explain full res vs 90hz.




### Brightness

The brightness is fine at 100%; it's noticeably dim when you first put on and take off the headset, but not during usage.
If I didn't block out the fan sound with earbuds I'd be tempted to try even dimmer.

The visuals are good enough that Half-Life Alyx's previously-astounding environments look visibly artificial.
It's possible that there's some geometry simplification going on to accomodate the high resolution, but I don't think so.
And Half-Life 2 finally looks quite dated -- still pretty, but obviously working with a highly constrained graphics budget.
Compound and Superhot don't go for realism and look better than ever.

### Comfort

I hardly ever play games for more than an hour, so I probably won't comment on long-term comfort.
Putting on the Beyond feels like swim goggles where the Reverb felt like a hat with a helmet attached.
After an hour of playing, it still feels quite comfortable, almost always beating the G2. 
(The Vive felt like a hat with a helmet that was cinched really tight with a band and felt uncomfortable within minutes.)
However, my face sweats more easily underneath the gasket. 
And it leaves me with two wicked marks, darker than I've gotten from my other two headsets.
This despite it being more comfortable than those two: I think it's because there's less pressure overall, it's just concentrated in two small spots.

A perk of the tiny size is that I can easily flip the headset up with one hand.
And the fit is solid enough that it goes right back in the exact correct place.
I haven't had too much trouble with the soft strap, despite my long, thick hair.
But it does need to be tightened every time I put the headset on.

Combined with the tiny sweet spot and tiny size of the headset, my normal headphones jostle it out of place.
I ordered some bluetooth earbuds and they work OK, except for the usual Bluetooth shenanigans.
But I'm going to order the audio strap if/when it's available, because I like the G2's Index-inspired strap so much.

### Software

It is good to be back on SteamVR-only.
Windows MR + SteamVR was a dumpster fire.
The only complaint I have is that SteamVR now uses the Steam Deck interface but doesn't support controller nagivation.

### 2D Games

I've tried to replace my old-ish 1080p/60hz TV with the Beyond but haven't had time to really test it out.
The default Steam Theatre is a little too big, causing me to move my eyes around.
This really doesn't work with the tiny sweet spot.

I'm on Windows 10 and got a headless ghost, thinking I could run a virtual screen at 1440p/75hz or 4k/75hz.
But I think that shrinking a virtual screen enough to avoid eye movement will mean that the additional resolution won't survive anyway.

### Summary

Summary of first impressions: this feels like a beta of a 3rd-gen headset, where the G2 felt like the polished tail of the 2nd-gen headsets.
There are a lot of minor omissions and mistakes that make this feel unpolished, but it's clearly better than what I've used before.

I'll turn this into a more complete review in a few months when I have more experience.
In the meantime I'm going to experiment with gasket size, since I've heard that all the lens issues are better with eyes closer to the screen.
